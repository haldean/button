  <p><a href="https://github.com/haldean/button">Button</a> is an interface for
  controlling the color and brightness of lights in your home. It turns your
  Android device into a motion controller, where one dimension is hue and the
  other is saturation.</p>

  <p>The controller itself is independent of any hardware configuration; it
  sends commands to a server which controls the lights themselves (in my system
  at home, I use <a href="https://github.com/haldean/dimsum">dimsum</a>). This
  architecture allows you to control your lights from anywhere using the Button
  controller.</p>

  <p>The real-time nature of the controller and the simple-to-understand
  mapping of motion to color makes it possible to play Button like an
  instrument. Playing music and making the lights pulse and change color with
  the beat is especially satisfying.</p>

  <p>You can download an APK from <a href=
  "https://github.com/haldean/button/downloads">Github</a>.</p>

  <h3 id="userinterface">User Interface</h3>

  <p>The UI of Button is about as simple as it gets: it’s just one big
  button.</p>

  <p>As the user tilts their device to the left and right, the hue shown in the
  circle changes. Tilting it 45 degrees with the left end down is red; as you
  tilt it more to the right, it cycles through orange, yellow, green, blue,
  purple and then back through to red at 45 degrees to the right.</p>

  <p>While the user is moving the device, the lights themselves do not change.
  When the user presses anywhere on the screen, though, the color on the screen
  gets sent to the lights. The user can hold their finger on the screen as they
  move the phone, and the lights will respond in real-time.</p>

  <p>Tilting the device away from the user changes the value of the light. When
  the phone is completely horizontal, the value goes to zero and the lights are
  off. When the phone is tilted 45 degrees or more in relation to the ground,
  the lights are at full. Again, the user can hold their finger on the screen
  and move the phone forwards and backwards to set the brightness of the
  lights.</p>

  <h3 id="useit">Use it</h3>

  <p>Because it requires so much configuration outside just acquiring the app,
  I have not tried to put Button up on the Play Market. You can download an APK
  from <a href="https://github.com/haldean/button/downloads">Github</a>. To use
  Button, you’ll need:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>RGB LEDs (I used <a href="http://adafruit.com/products/285">these from
    Adafruit</a>)
    </li>

    <li>an <a href="http://www.arduino.cc/">Arduino</a>
    </li>

    <li>a machine that can run a web server (I use a <a href=
    "http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi</a>)
    </li>

    <li>an Android phone</li>
  </ul>

  <p>First, wire up your LED strips as described <a href=
  "http://www.ladyada.net/products/rgbledstrip/">in this fantastic ladyada
  tutorial</a> and make sure your Arduino is working. Once that’s up, download
  <a href="https://github.com/haldean/dimsum">dimsum</a> and install the
  RgbSerial sketch included with it to your Arduino.</p>

  <p>Now start up your light host (in my case, the Raspberry Pi but any
  computer with a network connection will do) and fire up dimsum by
  running:</p>
  <pre>
<code>$ python dimsum.py --dimmer /dev/ttyUSB0
</code>
</pre>

  <p>You may need to change <code>ttyUSB0</code> to match the serial port that
  your Arduino is running on. You may need to run it as root to allow it to
  bind to port 80, or set the port to be over 1024 using the
  <code>--port</code> flag (recommended).</p>

  <p>Finally, install the APK, go to the settings and set the address and port
  of your light host. Make sure that the phone will be able to access this
  address; if you’re using an external IP, make sure your router is forwarding
  the correct ports (the correct ports are whatever you set for the HTTP server
  <em>in addition to</em> port 9000, which is used for the socket
  connection).</p>

  <p>If you don’t want to forward ports, you can use the IP of your host on the
  LAN, but you won’t be able to control your lights if you aren’t connected to
  your home wifi.</p>
